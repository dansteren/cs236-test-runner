{"name":"CS 236 Test Runner","tagline":"A simple bash script to compile and test your CS 236 Projects","body":"## About\r\nTest.sh is a comprehensive test runner. It can test your project against a single test case or a whole folder, with the additional option to compile your program before testing. It comes packaged with the test cases from the [course website](http://beta.cs.byu.edu/~cs236/tests/tests.php).\r\n\r\n##System Requirements\r\nThis test runner was designed for Linux systems, specifically Ubuntu, but should work just fine on macs as well. Windows users: sorry!\r\n\r\nAlso, the test runner checks code complexity using the pmccabe tool, and must be installed prior to use. If your distribution supports APT you can install pmccabe by running `sudo apt-get install pmccabe`.\r\n\r\n## Get Started\r\n\r\n1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of your project `cd path/to/project-files`\r\n2. Clone the test-runner repo: `git clone https://github.com/xaves/cs236-test-runner.git`\r\n3. Navigate inside the repo `cd cs236-test-runner`\r\n4. Make the file executable for your user: `chmod u+x test.sh`\r\n5. Update path variables (if necessary): `./test.sh -u`\r\n6. Run the script with any of the available options. `./test.sh <options>`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\nTest.sh can be run with various different options to provide additional functionality\r\n\r\n    -c     compile the program before running tests\r\n    -f     only test the file passed in\r\n    -h     display help\r\n    -p     run pmccabe only\r\n    -u     update output paths\r\n    -v     output version information\r\n\r\nExample: `./test.sh -cf 21`\r\n\r\n## Concerning Test files\r\n\r\nThe test runner comes packaged with the test files provided on the [course website](http://beta.cs.byu.edu/~cs236/tests/tests.php). Any additional tests you wish to run will have to be created manually.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n![cs236-test-runner](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5455419/13632178/a382c380-e5a5-11e5-90a7-a2962989f4f6.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
